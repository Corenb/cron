cron
====

 Cron expression parser and evaluator.  Based on Joda-time
 
 Allows for specifying cron - expressions i unix-format (or Quartz like format) and evaluating when it will next match.
 
 Since it's specified on Joda-time it allows for easy integration into unit testing as well, by adjusting the Joda-time offset.
